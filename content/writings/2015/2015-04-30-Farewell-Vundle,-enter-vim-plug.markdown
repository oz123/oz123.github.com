[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is a lean and clean new shiny plug-in manager which excels Vundle in many ways. The nicest thing about it is that you can load a specific version of a vim plug-in or load plug-in on demand. Thus allowing your vim to start much much faster, and require much less memory. 

vim-plug also supports parallel installation of plug-ins if you have vim compiled with python or ruby support! Here is screen-shot of vim-plug running when installing my 40 favorite plug-ins in parallel:
