I enjoy sharing what I have learned whether in this blog, in face to face time,
consulting or public speaking. I participate in a few meetup groups, and I
co-founded the [CNCF meetup in Nürnberg][2].
Over the years, I have given some presentations and workshops in smaller and larger
conferences. This page is an attempt to collect them all under one roof.

### Going Cloud - Deutsche OpenStack Tage, Berlin September, 2019

In this talk I gave an overview for non-technical and technical audience about
the significance of public and private clouds, as well as how important how
openstack is. On the other side, creating and maintaining a cloud can be a daunting
task. And once, you got a cloud, writing an application that fits the cloud, isn't
easy either. I discuss why it isn't easy, and how organization can change to adapt
themselves and the application to the cloud.

### Deployment Strategies with Kubernetes - Nürnberg Digital Festival, July, 2019

I this talk a gave an overview about deployment strategies with kubernetes. I gave
a short background to what kubernetes is, what are deployment strategies, which
ones are available in kubernetes and when each one should be used. The presentation
included a large live portion where I displayed the behaviour of each deployment
strategy on a live kubernetes cluster.
