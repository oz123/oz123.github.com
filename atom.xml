    Creating abstracted Dockerfile is something I really wish existed.
  Docker does not supply an abstraction around package managers in various
  Linux distributions. Here is a simple M4 schema how to do this. A better
  solution will probably invloved Jinja2 templating and code stealing from
  `pkg.install` in salt-stack modules.

  <title>On learning Ruby coming from Python ...</title>

    I am learning Ruby, and coming from Python it's not a an easy thing.
    Ruby is confusing, it has a weird syntax, and things are not really
    simple as in Python. There is still tons of stuff which seem like dark magic.
    There's `nil`, there are `gems` and `bundler`. And there is _Rails, 
    which isn't Ruby_. Ruby is good for so many people out there, and I am sure 
    you can do amazing things in it. I already know it's never going to be my 
    weapon of choice, but it's not bad knowing my way around it. I'd like to know 
    how to set up a simple project, read and debug code, install gems and package 
    ruby projects. I have been ignoring Ruby for too long.

    If you have a publicly available server you can setup a permanent SSH connection to it from your OpenWRT. Add remote port forwarding to the plan, and you get an easy way to always access your hosts where your OpenWRT router is.

  <title>Yet another case of Python vs. Regular Expressions</title>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    Regular Expressions are really awesome, and If you read the last post you might got the wrong impression I am totally against their use. I love using regular expressions, but sometimes, knowing Python is more than enough.

  <title>Python's regex is not always the best option</title>
  <link href="http://oz123.github.com/writings/2016-03-14-Regex/index.html" />
  <id>http://oz123.github.com/writings/2016-03-14-Regex/index.html</id>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    When programming in Python, regex are not always your best tool. This has a few reasons, regex can be computationally expensive, unreadable and unmaintainble, and finally, sometimes there is a better pythonic way without them. Here are a few examples.
