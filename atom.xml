    For quite a while now I wanted to have a cheap replacement for collecting
    and tracking coverage of codes I work on. Finally, I found a nice way to
    record and track coverage reporting inside git itself in a semi-automatic
    or completely automatic way.

  <title>Dockerfile quicky - templating with M4</title>

    Creating abstracted Dockerfile is something I really wish existed. Every time, 
    I write a `Dockerfile` for a specific base image I must specify the correct
    package manager command. You either use `apt-get` or `apk` or `yum` or any other
    call for the package manager. This is unfortunately, not very reusable. But,
    here is a simple schema how to use M4 macros to achieve this abstraction.

  <title>On learning Ruby coming from Python ...</title>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    I am learning Ruby, and coming from Python it's not a an easy thing.
    Ruby is confusing, it has a weird syntax, and things are not really
    simple as in Python. There is still tons of stuff which seem like dark magic.
    There's `nil`, there are `gems` and `bundler`. And there is _Rails, 
    which isn't Ruby_. Ruby is good for so many people out there, and I am sure 
    you can do amazing things in it. I already know it's never going to be my 
    weapon of choice, but it's not bad knowing my way around it. I'd like to know 
    how to set up a simple project, read and debug code, install gems and package 
    ruby projects. I have been ignoring Ruby for too long.

    If you have a publicly available server you can setup a permanent SSH connection to it from your OpenWRT. Add remote port forwarding to the plan, and you get an easy way to always access your hosts where your OpenWRT router is.

  <title>Yet another case of Python vs. Regular Expressions</title>

    Regular Expressions are really awesome, and If you read the last post you might got the wrong impression I am totally against their use. I love using regular expressions, but sometimes, knowing Python is more than enough.

  <title>Python's regex is not always the best option</title>
  <link href="http://oz123.github.com/writings/2016-03-14-Regex/index.html" />

  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    When programming in Python, regex are not always your best tool. This has a few reasons, regex can be computationally expensive, unreadable and unmaintainble, and finally, sometimes there is a better pythonic way without them. Here are a few examples.
