    After two years at noris network AG, yesterday was my last day with this company.
  It has been a long time since it felt so hard leaving a company. In my two years
    I worked with really great people on some of the most cutting edge technologies.
    All these things were not possible without the help of so many great people with
    whom I worked with. Some of them might read this post, so here is a big thanks.
    I wanted to summerize my two years and gather all the lessons I learned in one place
    for my future self and others too.  
    It's quite hard summerize such an eclectic post. It's been a wild ride in noris network
    with lots of new technologies and ideas. We have had a lot of success. I would like
    to think that a great part was because we opted to work in an open source matter,
    even thougah not all our projects where open source. This blog post is a summary of the
    good things we did, and the positive leasons we learned.  
    I hope reading through these will inspire you to choose a similar path.

    This is a short tutorial on how to build a data source for Grafana using Python
    Bottle micro-framework. Eventually, you can use this code to connect to any
    database (including SQLite).

    Fooling around with JavaScript and OpenPGP, as the title says. I needed to
        create a page in which I can encrypt files with OpenPGP. Doing this with JavaScript
        turned out to be possible. These are the results of my experiment.

  <title>backup and restore with duplicity</title>

    Duplicity backup utility is the old workhorse in all recent Ubuntu versions.
  I use the GUI called Deja-Dup for quite a while now. But until now I never bothered
  to check how to restore my files. I did decide to check how to restore file,
  because backup is only half the job! It turns out, that the GUI does a disservice
  for duplicity users. Restoring an encrypted backup turned out to not work.
  I didn't bother to research why, and turned to the CLI. This is a reminder on
  how to restore the files.

    The following screenshot of a systemd issue reported on github saysit all.  I don't care if systemd is technically superior, the way it's being
 developed is truely bothering. It's leadership is insisting on being blunt  ingoring users, misleading and even wrong.

  <title>Dockerfile quicky - templating with M4</title>

    Creating abstracted Dockerfile is something I really wish existed. Every time, 
    I write a `Dockerfile` for a specific base image I must specify the correct
    package manager command. You either use `apt-get` or `apk` or `yum` or any other
    call for the package manager. This is unfortunately, not very reusable. But,
    here is a simple schema how to use M4 macros to achieve this abstraction.
