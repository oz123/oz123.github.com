    Duplicity backup utility is the old workhorse in all recent Ubuntu versions.
  I use the GUI called Deja-Dup for quite a while now. But until now I never bothered
  to check how to restore my files. I did decide to check how to restore file,
  because backup is only half the job! It turns out, that the GUI does a disservice
  for duplicity users. Restoring an encrypted backup turned out to not work.
  I didn't bother to research why, and turned to the CLI. This is a reminder on
  how to restore the files.
