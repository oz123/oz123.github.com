    After two years at noris network AG, yesterday was my last day with this company.
  It has been a long time since it felt so hard leaving a company. In my two years
    I worked with really great people on some of the most cutting edge technologies.
    All these things were not possible without the help of so many great people with
    whom I worked with. Some of them might read this post, so here is a big thanks.
    I wanted to summerize my two years and gather all the lessons I learned in one place
    for my future self and others too.  
    It's quite hard summerize such an eclectic post. It's been a wild ride in noris network
    with lots of new technologies and ideas. We have had a lot of success. I would like
    to think that a great part was because we opted to work in an open source matter,
    even thougah not all our projects where open source. This blog post is a summary of the
    good things we did, and the positive leasons we learned.  
    I hope reading through these will inspire you to choose a similar path.
