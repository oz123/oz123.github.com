    This is a short tutorial on how to build a data source for Grafana using Python
    Bottle micro-framework. Eventually, you can use this code to connect to any
    database (including SQLite).

  <title>On learning Ruby coming from Python ...</title>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    I am learning Ruby, and coming from Python it's not a an easy thing.
    Ruby is confusing, it has a weird syntax, and things are not really
    simple as in Python. There is still tons of stuff which seem like dark magic.
    There's `nil`, there are `gems` and `bundler`. And there is _Rails, 
    which isn't Ruby_. Ruby is good for so many people out there, and I am sure 
    you can do amazing things in it. I already know it's never going to be my 
    weapon of choice, but it's not bad knowing my way around it. I'd like to know 
    how to set up a simple project, read and debug code, install gems and package 
    ruby projects. I have been ignoring Ruby for too long.

  <title>Yet another case of Python vs. Regular Expressions</title>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    Regular Expressions are really awesome, and If you read the last post you might got the wrong impression I am totally against their use. I love using regular expressions, but sometimes, knowing Python is more than enough.

  <title>Python's regex is not always the best option</title>
  <link href="http://oz123.github.com/writings/2016-03-14-Regex/index.html" />
  <id>http://oz123.github.com/writings/2016-03-14-Regex/index.html</id>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    When programming in Python, regex are not always your best tool. This has a few reasons, regex can be computationally expensive, unreadable and unmaintainble, and finally, sometimes there is a better pythonic way without them. Here are a few examples.
