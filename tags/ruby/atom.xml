    I am learning Ruby, and coming from Python it's not a an easy thing.
    Ruby is confusing, it has a weird syntax, and things are not really
    simple as in Python. There is still tons of stuff which seem like dark magic.
    There's `nil`, there are `gems` and `bundler`. And there is _Rails, 
    which isn't Ruby_. Ruby is good for so many people out there, and I am sure 
    you can do amazing things in it. I already know it's never going to be my 
    weapon of choice, but it's not bad knowing my way around it. I'd like to know 
    how to set up a simple project, read and debug code, install gems and package 
    ruby projects. I have been ignoring Ruby for too long.
