	<h1>On learning Ruby coming from Python ...</h1>
	<p>I am learning Ruby, as coming from Python it's not a very easy thing.
Ruby is confusing, it has a weired syntax, and things are not really simple as
in Python.
There is still tons of stuff which dark magic. There's <code>nil</code>, there are <code>gems</code>
and <code>bundler</code>. And there is <em>Rails, isn't Ruby</em>.
Ruby was good for so many people out there, and I am sure you can do amazing stuff
in it. I already know it's never going to be my weapon of choice, but it's not
bad knowing my way around it. I'd like to know how to set up a simple project,
read and debug code, install gems and package ruby projects. I have been ignoring
Ruby for too long.</p>

<p>Well, that is a lie. I never ignored it. There many applications that I use, which
are using Ruby, and the language always intrigued me. I met some really cool people
working with this language, which made me curious about it. But I was afraid of
entering a new realm, being incapable again in a programming language is something
I am not really fond of, if the benefits are not that big for me.</p>

<p>Python offered more for me, coming from science and High Performance computing,
so I picked it first, when I had to choose a scripting language to automate
computational stuff. I didn't reject Ruby, but it didn't offer tools like Matplotlib,
SciPy or Pandas. It had Rails, and that is all I knew about Ruby more or less.
And unfortunately, that was enough to discourage me from learning it for the last
8 years. Alas, the time for me to learn Ruby has come.</p>

<p>A great catalyst for this is watching the video casts in destroyallsoftware.com,
which often use Ruby. And here something Gary Bernhardt, who makes these casts, 
put very nicely in his cast about packaging in Python and Ruby:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Python tends to have very good fundamentals, but not such good interface on 
  top of them. Whereas Ruby tends to have no as quite thought out fundamental 
  solution, but the interface on it tends to be nicer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a citation from 2011, where pip was so new, and there was no <code>virtualenv-wrapper</code>.
Eventually, I think if your foundations are good, people will build good interfaces.</p>

<p>Installing ruby packages was for me always a magic, which I didn't understand.
After watching this screen-cast, I understand better what is going on when I do
<code>gem install ...</code>. But I also think that Python does have a simpler  and better 
interface for package installation. It's very UNIX, and it's simpler. There is 
no bundler, bundler exec, no multiple versions installed of a package installed
inside a virtualenv (Ruby allows multiple versions installed side by side).</p>

<p>This is also a very large trend between the two languages, which I see early on.
Python tends to be simpler where it can. It might no be as fun and magical an in
Ruby. But it makes the code simpler and the maintenance easier. It is the Zen of Python,
where "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it." and
readability and simplicity count.</p>

<p>Ruby has some cool tricks, and I think it's OK to use it. However, it will not be my
weapon of choice, if can choose Python. Never the less, learning Ruby helps me 
understand things Python. This is either through reflection over stuff that has
already become transparent or through rethinking aspects of Object Orientation 
and Design as are those expressed in Ruby when I compare them to Python. So despite
my frustrations with Ruby, it's a fun ride, and I recommend investing sometime in
looking into Ruby.</p>
