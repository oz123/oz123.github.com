	<h1>Better Apps in Linux</h1>
	<p>I don't know why, but I have the feeling that the rise of Ubuntu, does
not bring Linux forward. I have read a few posts about it. And I think
that the focus of Linux developers is starting to annoy me so much that
I am thinking of ripping Linux off my Laptop and just installing *BSD,
although I'd have to twitch my nose, because I prefer GPL over BSD.\
My rant is about things like GNOME3, KDE4, UNITY and stupidities like
systemd. The first two idiotic examples are a proof of how FOSS
developers can be totally disconnected from their users. I mean, KDE4
and GNOME3 both seek to re-invent the user experience. However, the firm
hold of windows in the market, shows that user experience is not such
big deal. Rather, I think, applications and stability are more
important. \
True, Windows suck big time. I hate the thought of using such a flawed
OS. However, Windows Jane and Joe, don't care. They just want their
Photoshop and Adobe Acrobat to work. And while cool Dave has his Unity
blowing off cool effects, he can't properly annotate PDFs, while GNOME
and Ubuntu developers are still fighting if the awesome bar should be in
the bottom of the screen or on the left side. \
Systemd, sounds really like an amazing piece of software, which can
really fly my laptop to mars upon boot. However, I boot my computer only
once in 2-3 months, when I upgrade my kernel, and frankly, I don't care
if it takes 2 minutes to boot. The same is true for all Windows 7 users.
\
Last week, I was riding the train, and the guy next too me booted his
Windows XP - took him 5 minutes until he got to his email software. But
you know what ? When he did get to it, it worked. \
I am at the point, that I am using Linux for 5 years now, and I will
never install Windows on a friend's computer. However, I feel that Linux
apps really annoy me sometimes. And this week, I just discovered it
again, while downloading a PDF with FORMS, which only worked with ADOBE
READER for Linux. Evince and Okular the two leading FOSS PDF readers
just failed to fill the forms and save the document. Now you can tell
me, I can open bugs - which I did (2 and 3 years ago) and they are still
not attended, because like I said, the BAR and Desktop effects are more
important. Of course, I can role my sleeves up, and put some effort and
code it. But at the same time, I can just apt-get ADOBE Reader from
Debian's non-free repository. \
I hate that last option, and I wish it was the other way. So if some one
in GNOME or KDE reads this post, please, forgot about stupid stuff like
the SHELL or PLASMOIDS, we don't care about that crap. We want
applications that can do more, for less memory, and for less CPU, that
will be stable, and have more features than their WINDOWS counters. And
then people will come. \
This is also trough, not just for PDF reader, but to ALL KINDS of
commercial software which abundant for WINDOWS but lack for Linux. The
gaming industry has picked it up, and the picture is starting to change.
Next I hope to see CAx software, accounting and banking, medical
software and more. When these will come, it won't mater if Linux will
have Plasmoids or Unity or the SHELL. \
Want a Proof ? Look at MacOS, although it is a FAR better operating
system then WINDOWS, it stayed always in a niche. Why ? Because Apple
played close, and developers did not develop commercial apps to it,
compared to the amount of apps available for Windows. Of course,
commercial, does not have to be closed source. On the contrary,
commercial should be open too.\
But that is for another post. \
I'll sum up, forgot the decorative stuff like SHELL, PLASMOIDS or UNITY.
Give us better applications, better than WINDOWS, and people will rush
to LINUX.\
